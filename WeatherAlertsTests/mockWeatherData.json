Widespread snow\naccumulations of 1 to 2 inches are expected with two embedded\ncorridors of higher snow totals where amounts could push 3 to 4\ninches. The northern corridor is expected to run from roughly\nMankato, MN northeast to near Wausau, WI while the second band\ndevelops along or just south of Interstate 90 in far southeast\nMinnesota and southwest Wisconsin. However, there is uncertainty\nin where these two bands exactly set up, which will impact\nforecast snow amounts. This snow could lead to slippery travel\novernight and possibly for the Thursday morning commute on any\nuntreated roads.\n\n* WHAT...Snow expected. Total snow accumulations of 2 to 4 inches.\nThe snow may come down at rates of over 1 inch per hour for\nshort periods of time.\n\n* WHERE...Portions of southeast Minnesota and central, southwest\nand west central Wisconsin.\n\n* WHEN...From midnight tonight to 6 AM CST Thursday.\n\n* IMPACTS...Plan on slippery road conditions.\n\n* ADDITIONAL DETAILS...There may be a narrow band of greater than\n4 inches of snow that develops along or slightly south of\nInterstate 90, but confidence in amounts or the band's exact\nlocation is low at the present time.",

Freezing rain chances will reach as far north\nas Kivalina by Tuesday afternoon. Ice accumulations of up to one\ntenth of an inch are possible, with snow amounts ranging from 2\nto 5 inches where Winter Storm Warnings are not in effect. Higher\nsnow totals are likely in the Bendeleben Mountains and where\nwarnings are in effect.\n\nThe system will also bring strong southeast winds gusting as high\nas 50 mph to the West Coast and to hills near the coast from\nMonday afternoon through Tuesday night. This will cause sea levels\nto rise 1 to 2 feet south of the Bering Strait on Tuesday and\nWednesday. While flooding of infrastructure is not expected, these\nstrong winds may cause water to be pushed on top of the sea ice\nmaking travel difficult.\n\nResidents should stay tuned to the latest forecast updates at\nwww.weather.gov/afg and prepare for a stormy start to the week.",
